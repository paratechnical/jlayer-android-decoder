This is a modified version of JLayer MP3 library (decoder portion only) to build for 
the Android SDK. Any files that were modified have been mentioned at the top. I've 
tried to make sure I follow the rules properly regarding the license (LGPL v1) and
have included it. The purpose is to keep this code separate and include it as a 
submodule in an app I am working on. I didn't see a repo with this available yet
so hopefully if its useful to others, they can just include it as a submodule as
well.
